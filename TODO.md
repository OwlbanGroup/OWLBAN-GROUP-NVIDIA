# TODO - Complete Master Plan Execution

## Phase 1: Foundation & Testing (Months 1-3) - CRITICAL

### 1.1 Quantum AI System Validation

- [x] Run comprehensive quantum algorithm tests across all modules
- [x] Validate NVIDIA GPU acceleration performance using DCGM monitoring
- [x] Benchmark AI model accuracy and inference speed
- [x] Test integration across quantum_financial_ai and new_products
- [ ] Compare performance vs. classical systems

### 1.2 Banking Applications Perfection

- [x] Test JPMorgan API integration end-to-end
- [x] Validate payment processing workflows
- [x] Test treasury management operations
- [x] Verify risk analysis calculations
- [x] Test multi-currency international transfer testing

### 1.3 Global Infrastructure Validation

- [ ] Test multi-cloud deployment functionality (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- [ ] Validate quantum data center operations
- [ ] Test edge computing network (50+ global locations)
- [ ] Verify global load balancing
- [ ] Test cross-region data replication

### 1.4 End-to-End Integration Testing

- [ ] Run complete system integration using test_e2e_smoke.py
- [ ] Validate 10B user scale journey
- [ ] Test $100T transaction processing
- [ ] Verify global latency and performance
- [ ] Confirm security and compliance

### 1.5 Infrastructure Enhancements

- [ ] Deploy global cloud infrastructure
- [ ] Set up enterprise database architecture (CockroachDB, YugabyteDB)
- [ ] Implement quantum-accelerated CDN
- [ ] Configure distributed database clusters

## Execution Notes

- Start with E2E smoke test to validate current system state
- Run quantum AI tests next
- Follow with banking application tests
- Complete infrastructure validation
- Update this TODO as tasks are completed
