# E2E Perfection Testing TODO

**Objective:** Verify that everything is 100% E2E perfect through comprehensive testing

## Phase 1: Quantum AI System Testing (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Run comprehensive quantum algorithm tests on all quantum modules
- [ ] Validate NVIDIA GPU acceleration performance using DCGM monitoring
- [ ] Test AI model accuracy and inference speed across combined_nim_owlban_ai modules
- [ ] Execute integration tests across all AI products (quantum_financial_ai, new_products, etc.)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking vs. classical systems using quantum_monitor.py

## Phase 2: Banking Applications Testing
- [ ] Test JPMorgan API integration end-to-end using jpmorgan_api_integration.py
- [ ] Validate payment processing workflows in banking_payment_app.py
- [ ] Test treasury management operations in banking_treasury_app.py
- [ ] Execute risk analysis calculations in banking_risk_app.py
- [ ] Multi-currency and international transfer testing across banking apps

## Phase 3: Global Infrastructure Testing
- [ ] Test multi-cloud deployment functionality using azure_integration_manager.py
- [ ] Validate quantum data center operations with energy_optimizer.py
- [ ] Edge computing network testing with global_consciousness_network.py
- [ ] Global load balancing verification using quantum_ai_global_deployment.py
- [ ] Cross-region data replication testing with database_manager.py

## Phase 4: End-to-End Integration Testing
- [ ] Complete system integration testing using tests/test_e2e_smoke.py
- [ ] User journey validation (10B user scale) via web_dashboard.py and api_server.py
- [ ] Transaction processing at $100T scale testing with banking apps
- [ ] Global latency and performance testing using monitoring/prometheus.yml
- [ ] Security and compliance validation across all systems

## Phase 5: Production Deployment Verification
- [ ] System availability testing (99.9% uptime target)
- [ ] Latency testing (<1 second for critical operations)
- [ ] Scalability testing (auto-scaling within 30 seconds)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting verification
- [ ] Disaster recovery and backup validation

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass with 100% success rate
- Performance metrics meet or exceed targets
- No critical bugs or security vulnerabilities
- Full E2E workflow validation confirmed
