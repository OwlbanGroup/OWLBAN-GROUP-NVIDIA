   - Review documentation and usage.

## Analysis

1. Review the architecture and functionalities of NVIDIA NIM.
2. Review the architecture and functionalities of OWLBAN GROUP AI.
3. Identify integration points, such as:
   - Data pipelines.
   - Model deployment.
   - Resource management.
   - APIs and SDKs compatibility.

## Integration Plan

1. Set up a unified project repository.
2. Integrate NVIDIA NIM components for infrastructure management.
3. Integrate OWLBAN GROUP AI components for AI functionalities.
4. Develop interfaces or adapters to enable communication between the two.
5. Test combined functionalities for performance and correctness.

## Follow-up Steps
